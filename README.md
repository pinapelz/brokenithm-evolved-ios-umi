# Brokenithm-Evolved-iOS-Umi
A version of [esterTion/Brokenithm-iOS](https://github.com/esterTion/Brokenithm-iOS) but maps inputs to keybinds and has support for slider LEDs based on the [Umiguri LED Controller Protocol]

Allows you to use a wired Brokenithm connection with Umiguri and also get all the flashy lights

This app only works while connected via USB to the PC (this significantly reduces input latency while the router is congested). Use [slidershim](https://github.com/4yn/slidershim) if you are looking for a wireless solution.
