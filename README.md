# Brokenithm-Evolved-iOS-Umi
A version of [esterTion/Brokenithm-iOS](https://github.com/esterTion/Brokenithm-iOS) but maps inputs to keybinds and has support for slider LEDs based on the [Umiguri LED Controller Protocol](https://gist.github.com/inonote/00251fed881a82c9df1e505eef1722bc)

This app only works while connected via USB to the PC (this significantly reduces input latency while the router is congested). Use [slidershim](https://github.com/4yn/slidershim) if you are looking for a wireless solution.
